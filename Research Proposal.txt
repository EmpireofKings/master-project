# Problem Setting

Our goal is to train a team of autonomous drones to explore an unknown area as most efficient
as possible in order to find a given target. This setting leads to a wide range of problems.
We want to focus on the following aspects, whereby the order represents our priority.

1.	Synchronisation
Every drone in the team must synchronize with other drones to avoid work that has already been done.
This implies that the droneâ€™s individual decision-making, i.e. path planning depends not only on its
own past decisions and its current environment, but also on decisions of other drones. The decision-making
may be done by a central control drone or by all drones simultaneously. This setting further implies that
the connection to other drones may get lost if the drones swarm out too far from each other.

2.	SLAM
Every drone must explore its surrounding area in order to find the target. This is known as Simultaneous 
Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). This can be done using any available sensor input, e.g. camera frames and GPS.

3.	Object Recognition
The team of drones should be able to identify any given target and communicate this event back to the operator.

Assumptions
-	Search area is limited beforehand by the operator
-	Target is easy to identify
-	Exploration is time-critical
-	Drones are able to fly stable in the given direction and are already able to avoid small obstacles (trees, power poles, etc.) by themselves.

Out of scope:
-	Technical details about hardware and communication
-	Detection of many targets in the given area
-	Optimization with regard to most efficient use of hardware resources
